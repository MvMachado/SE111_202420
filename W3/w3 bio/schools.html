            <p> I went to <u>William M. Davies</u> for all 4 years of my life and was a very interesting experience in my early life. Graduated in 2020 and went into the culinary program and never switched unlike few friends of mine in the past.
                I learned many great things there and enjoyed much of my experience and highly reccomend going there especially for the technology side.  
            </p>
 
            <br>
 
            <p> After few months break Since graduation I applied to <u>CCRI</u> and attended to their onlines classes for a few terms for a Art degree. However that dream was quickly equinguished
                 when it was extremely difficult to learn within the circumstances of covid and classes so I took my leave. 
            </p>
 
            <br>
 
            <p> Finally from working for a few years within covid situation instead of studying I took the initive and decided to go into computer science to learn cyber security.
                 From the past few months this has been a wonderful experience to learn here and hope to learn much more and do my best for my future and family.
            </p>
