            <h2 class="fancy border"> Gamings, Song writing, Foreign language </h2>
      
            <p>One of my personal hobbies is trying out all sorts of games from retro,horror,survival and many more. However my personal favorite that are always able to keep me interested
                is Final Fantasy XIV with how lovely the graphics is for updated and frequently developed game for modern gaming with change of graphics while developing interesting stories. 
                As well as another game that takes my fancy the most would be Okami for its unique art style and wonderful story and multiple questlines you can do to develope your relationship
                with the people through out the country.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> Song writing has always been a personal favorite hobby to do on my own free time at. At first i would consider writing poetry and when I think of a beat I slowly go from there
                However alot of my songs go through rough draphs till I feel happy with them. I sadly dont post actual song cause I have little knowledge on how to create a song and mess with vocals
                but one day that is one of my goals to achieve. I also write english cover to some songs that are in different langauge that have yet get a adaption. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Lastly one of my secret hobbys is learning or understanding foreign languages that arent within my vocab. Because of my family already knowing Spanish and English 
                Yet another language im learning and try to speak is portuguese beause of a few influencers that I found to be quite entertaining and hopes that someday I wont 
                need a translator to tell me what their saying in english. yet funny enough ive learned that portuguese is very similar to spanish so it helps out with understanding some words.
