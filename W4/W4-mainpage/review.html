                The show was of extremely amazing quality and worth the 4 years of waiting from the pilot being release in October 28, 2019.
                Even though the episodes are very short with 8 episodes in total excluding the pilot it was very enjoyable to watch with the music.
                My Personal favorite song from the show are as follows.

                <li>Hell's Greatest Dad</li>

                <li>It Starts With Sorry</li>

                <li>Ready For This</li>
            </u1>
                
            <P>
                The animation quality is extremely good with not holding back on the themes of the show taking place in hell. 
                Ending with tiny little details regarding the characters we havent met yet as well with some idea that could happen within the next season!

                    <u1>
                        <li>Trivia #1</li> 
                        <P>Viv admits that Alastor is an "edgy, DeviantArt oc" that she made in high school, which makes him her oldest character created.</P>
                        <li>Trivia #2</li>
                        <p>Angel Dust's third set of arms can be retracted so that he appears to only have two sets of arms simply because it's easier to animate.</p>
                        <li>Trivia #3</li>
                        <p> Being a show which takes place in Hell, it makes sense that its release date would be October 28, 2019, just three days before Halloween.</p>
